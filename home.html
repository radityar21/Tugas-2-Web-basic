                        I, Ichinosuke, failed to get a job for 100 consecutive times. Furthermore, my record is still being updated as unemployed. On my way to a job interview, I was involved in an accident with a truck and tragically passed away. And then, a Goddess bestowed
                        upon me the ability to grow at a speed 400 times faster than normal, before sending me to a game-like otherworld. However, knowing that I would not become stronger even if I continued growing while jobless, I aimed to get a job,
                        but I found out that it was my terrible fate to remain jobless. As my Growth Cheat and Jobless Cheat existed side-by-side in this otherworld, an adventure record, no doubt certified by the job-placement agency as a harmful book,
                        begins here.

                        In a Fantasy world in which a young girl with the Divine Protection of the Hero battles against the Demon Lord. In that world, Red, the elder brother of that young girl Hero, possessing the Divine Protection of the Guide which only grants a high initial
                        level, fought in the initial party of the Hero. However, with a Divine Protection that only grants a high level but no magic nor martial art nor supernatural ability, he gradually could no longer keep up with the battle and in
                        the end, a companion, a Sage, remarked ‘You are not a true companion’ as he snatched all his equipment and kicked him out of the party with just a single copper sword. Having his heart completely shattered, Red distanced himself
                        from the battle against the Demon Lord’s army despite knowing that the fate of the world rests on it, aiming to live an inconspicuous life alone at the frontier Zoltan as he earns money to open a herbalist shop by utilizing the
                        knowledge he acquired throughout his journey. Together with the Half-Elf Carpenter living downtown and the Princess who couldn’t become the Hero’s companion, he aims to live a slow life in the frontier of the world governed by
                        a person’s inborn Divine Protection!
